          <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
          <p>
            NAPSSOSA is more than an alumni body — it is a movement. A movement driven by
            gratitude for what Nabingoola gave us, and by a determination to ensure that
            every student who passes through its gates has access to the same opportunities,
            if not better ones, than we had. Together, we are stronger. Together, we move
            Nabingoola forward.
